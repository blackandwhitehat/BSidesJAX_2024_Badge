# Circuit 1 \- Assembly Instructions

1. Inventory your parts, before starting you should have:   
   1. A bag that contains:  
      1. 1 Switch  
      2. 1 Battery Holder  
      3. 1 Battery  
      4. 1 SAO Header  
   2. Two LEDs of your choosing  
   3. If you do not have the required parts, talk to Soldering Village volunteers  
2. Solder your components to the board using the below methods. Ensure that parts are on the correct side of board before applying Solder.   
   1. LEDs and SAO header go on the front  
   2. The rest of the components go on the back

   

# Circuit 2 \- Assembly Instructions

**Remove SMD components from their packaging BY COLOR ONLY when you are ready to solder that specific color as some components look identical.**

Take care when removing SMD components from their packaging as they are small and easy to lose. Open them right above your silicone mat and understand that if you lose components we may not be able to provide replacements or tell you to come back later in the day.  

There are two methods to solder the Surface-Mount components: 

## Soldering Iron

1. Open **ONLY** the component you are soldering  
2. Apply solder to one of the componentâ€™s pads  
3. Heat the pad  
4. Use tweezers to move component onto pad while moving soldering iron away  
   1. The most important thing is making sure the component is in place and flat on the board, you can always add more solder or touch up after the next step  
5. Apply heat to the other pad and add solder

## Hotplate

1. Open **ONLY** the component you are soldering  
2. Heat hotplate to 200C  
3. Place working area of badge over the hotplate, you will be doing LF and HF sections separately due to the limited size of the hot plate  
4. Apply liquid solder to the pads using a syringe  
   1. Use a TINY amount to start, you can always add more  
   2. Wait for solder to melt and ball up on the pads  
   3. If you use too much and need it removed ask for help using wick or the solder sucker  
5. Use tweezers to move all section components onto the board  
   1. Components should be as close to flat as possible, if they are coming up off the board ask for help removing solder   
6. Repeat steps 1-4 until all components are placed in the section you are working on
